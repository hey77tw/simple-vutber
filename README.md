## üéÆ Usage Instructions

1. **Launch Application**: Double-click desktop shortcut or launch from start menu
2. **Allow Microphone Permission**: When prompted by the system, allow the application to access the microphone
3. **Start Speaking**: Speak into the microphone, and the character will automatically change mouth expressions based on volume
4. **Adjust Volume**: You can adjust system volume or microphone volume to test different effects
5. **Mouth Shape Training**: To get better mouth synchronization, practice pronouncing vowel sounds (A, E, I, O, U) clearly at different volumes. The application will automatically switch between different mouth shapes based on your voice intensity and frequency patterns
